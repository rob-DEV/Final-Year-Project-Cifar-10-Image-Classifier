# FYP CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

Final Year Project aiming to research and implement feature extraction and image classification techniques.

* Loading of CIFAR-10 dataset and pre processing
* HOG feature extraction and visualization
* Edge extraction
* Histogram extraction
* SIFT partially implemented

* KNN classifcation
* Logistic Regression
* CNN and Dense Neural Network

## Usage
The project consists of 3 runner scripts and must be ran using the venv.

1. Run `main_ui.py` launch the UI this is the desired application entry point the other are defocused
2. Run `main_dev.py` which is used to run features currently in development.
3. Run `main_interim_demo.py` which runs the material demonstrated in the interim demo.
